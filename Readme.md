# eCommerce Order Packaging System

This project simulates a product ordering and packaging system. The application allows users to select multiple products, place an order, and see how the selected items are split into packages based on predefined constraints like price limits and courier shipping weight rules.

---

## üöÄ **Features**

- **Product List Display**: Shows all products with checkboxes to select items.
- **Place Order**: Submits selected items to the server for packaging calculation.
- **Package Calculation**: Automatically splits the selected items into packages while adhering to:
  - Maximum total cost of $250 per package for international customs purposes.
  - Even distribution of weight across multiple packages.
- **Courier Charges**: Displays shipping costs based on total weight of each package.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**

### **Frontend**
- React + Vite
- TypeScript
- Axios
- CSS (Custom Styles)

### **Backend**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## üèóÔ∏è **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### **1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fearalert/geek_tech/
cd backend_task
```

---

### **2. Set up Backend**

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd geektech_backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### **3. Set up Frontend**

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd geektech_nodeapp_frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### **4. Access the App**

Once both the backend and frontend are running, open your browser and go to:
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

---

## üìä **How It Works**

1. **Load Products**:
   Products are seeded when backend is connected to db and dynamically fetched from the backend and rendered in the product list with their respective prices and weights.

2. **Select Products**:
   Users can select products by clicking the checkboxes.

3. **Place Order**:
   Clicking **Place Order** sends the selected items to the server.

4. **Server Logic**:
   The server splits items into packages based on:
   - Maximum allowed cost per package: **$250**
   - Even weight distribution across multiple packages.
   - Courier cost is calculated based on weight ranges.

5. **View Results**:
   The frontend displays the result in multiple packages with their total weight, price, and shipping costs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Backend Schema**

### `Product Schema`

Stores product details like name, price, and weight.

```javascript
const ProductSchema: Schema = new Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  price: { type: Number, required: true },
  weight: { type: Number, required: true },
});
```

### `Order Schema`

For storing the result of package calculation when an order is placed.

```javascript
const OrderSchema = new Schema<IOrder>({
  selectedItems: {
    type: [String],
    required: true,
  },
  packages: [
    {
      packageNumber: { type: Number, required: true },
      items: { type: [String], required: true },
      totalPrice: { type: Number, required: true },
      totalWeight: { type: Number, required: true },
      courierPrice: { type: Number, required: true },
    },
  ],
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
});
```

## üì¶ **API Endpoints**

### 1. **`GET /api/products/get`**
Fetch all the products available in the store.

---

### 2. **`POST /api/orders/place-order`**
Receives selected items from the frontend and calculates packages based on rules.
